**General**

This is a HTTP server has 2 purposes:
1. Web-application (Angular) for automation status
2. Gateway to publish notification to CI-3 Team in Microsoft Teams.
In order to inform the relevant team members about your final CI results, we have set up a gateway to publish notifications to a Microsoft Teams channel. The gateway will automatically send notifications to the Teams channel you have configured, so that all relevant stakeholders can stay informed and take action if necessary.
